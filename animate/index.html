                    		Chinese animated film "Ne Zha" has shattered records since its domestic debut on July 26, raking in 611 million U.S. dollars by August 23 to become the third highest-grossing film in the Chinese mainland. Globally, it now ranks 49th on the list of top-grossing animated movies at the box office.
                    		<br>
                    		<br>
                    		"Ne Zha" is loosely based on the Chinese novel "Investiture of the Gods" and the latest exhibit in a long-running trend of using Intellectual Property (IP) in the Chinese animation industry.

                    		<p>From relying on domestic IPs to experimenting with original storylines and foreign IP adaptations, Chinese animated films have reinvented themselves over 70 years of development. The phenomenal sensation brought by "Monkey King: Hero is Back" in 2015 has whetted the Chinese audience's appetite for a solid "Chinese story," while the megahit "Ne Zha" this year is fueling further explorations of local traditional IPs.</p>

			        <p>Before the turn of the 21st Century, domestic IPs, mainly works of literature, inspired big-screen animations in China. "The Monkey King" and "the Monkey King Conquers the Demon" were both adapted from "Journey to the West," one of the four classics of Chinese literature, while folktale "The Magic Lotus Lantern" brought about "Lotus Lantern."

		        	The year 2000 witnessed a burgeoning shift in preferences as filmmakers began to slowly ditch local IPs for foreign copyrights. That year, 40% of the animated films that hit the theaters were adapted from Chinese IPs.

		        <p>Since 2013, foreign IPs have become a fixture in Chinese IP films. "The New Pinocchio," "Alibaba and The Thief" and "Tale of the Rally," which is based on "The Tortoise and the Hare," are examples of Chinese renditions of literature imports.</p>
		        <br>
				<p>Fairy tales, folktales and fables are good fodder for animated films not just in China. Of the 57 Disney animated productions, 46 are either based or inspired by these genres.

		        <p>The "Kung Fu Panda" trilogy might be the most popular China-centric animations, but the franchise is essentially a U.S. IP created by Dream Works Animation. The third installment, however, is a co-production between Chinese and U.S. companies, and the most successful foreign IP adaptation in Chinese animation industry to this date. It hauled in 10 billion yuan (1.4 billion U.S. dollars), but the exceptional performance is a breakaway success for foreign IP adaptations in the country. </p>

		        <p>A look at the top 10 box office hits in Chinese animated film industry shows that local IP films fare better than adaptations of foreign IPs. Films adapted from classic literature and mythology are also more likely to become blockbusters. "Monkey King: Hero is Back," White Snake" and "Ne Zha" are all cases in point.</p>
		        <br>
				<p>Traditional Chinese IPs have also found fame in overseas movie markets.  Disney's "Mulan" is adapted from 6th-century poem "The Ballad of Mulan" and the "Dragon Ball" franchise is inspired by "Journey to the West."
